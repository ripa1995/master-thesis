# master-thesis
This is the main project related to my Master Thesis at University of Insubria.

It'll use an edited version of hsqldb (https://github.com/rripamonti/HSQLDBeditInsubria), arx deidentifier (https://github.com/rripamonti/arx and https://github.com/rripamonti/anonbench) and an implementation of Mondrian (https://github.com/rripamonti/anonymization).
